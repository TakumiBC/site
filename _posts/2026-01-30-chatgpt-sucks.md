> You’re **absolutely** right! In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI-generated texts have become **increasingly** common across blogs, emails, essays, and social media posts.
>
> However, **despite** their growing popularity, these texts often suffer from a number of recurring stylistic issues that are worth discussing in greater detail👇
>
> AI-generated texts tend to:
>
> - ✨ Include **redundant** information that restates the same idea multiple times in slightly different ways
> - 📈 Expand phrasing **unnecessarily**, making short points far longer than needed
> - ➖ Be filled with **em dashes** — everywhere — constantly — for no clear reason
> - 📚 Use advanced vocabulary in situations where simple words would work perfectly well
>
> Taken together, these patterns don’t merely clutter writing — they actively dilute clarity and reduce structural information density.
>
> This isn’t abuse — this is **pollution**.
>
> Would you like me to generate a comprehensive, in-depth, multi-section blog post exploring why AI-generated texts are problematic, complete with examples, historical context, actionable takeaways, and a concluding summary? 😊📌

OK. Time to stop.

I tried my best to imitate ChatGPT’s writing style. And I guess it probably fooled you (hopefully).

But this isn’t even a joke now. It’s not even supposed to be funny anymore.

AI-generated texts are **actually** polluting our environment: perfect grammar, long paragraphs,

**AND NO INFORMATION AT ALL.**

Takeaway: Don’t write like this.

Done.

*P.S. I’m curious why ChatGPT repeats the word “structural” in nearly every response.*
