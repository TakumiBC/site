## **Head**

We all love Reviewers. Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3 — whatever.

But what if the lovely Reviewer 1 gave you a **0** with **confidence 5**?

## **Neck**

That’s exactly what happened to ICLR 2026 submission no. 21536 (See https://openreview.net/forum?id=tvDlQj0GZB).

**Impressive!** At least he didn’t use ChatGPT for reviewing that paper?

Or no. Maybe bro forgot to upload the PDF to ChatGPT when vibe-reviewing.

## **Body**

The title of the paper is *“Learning is Forgetting; LLM Training As Lossy Compression”*.

Of course it was quite controversial. Just like how **I** write my blog posts.

But is it worth a 0? Not at all.

I read the work thoroughly. There’s **nothing** wrong in the paper that’s worth a strong reject. The literature was clear, the essay was neat, the math is justified (probably — don’t ask me).

But what is this reviewer doing????

## **Heart**

And now let’s look at the peak moment of Reviewer 1. Even better than the 0.

> **Strengths:** None noted. See explanation in the weaknesses.
> NONE.

## **Legs**

Now let’s look at what the other reviewers gave:

- Reviewer 2: **2**
- Reviewer 3: **6**
- Reviewer 4: **6**

Still a tough round.

But shout-out to the AC for accepting this paper.

## **Foot**

Reviewer 1 probably wouldn’t want to receive a review like this.

So do I. And you.

So write reviews respectfully, justlike what **you** want to receive.

Done.
