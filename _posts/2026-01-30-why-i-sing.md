Before we start: we all know that the KJV is the only correct version of the Bible, and it has more authority than the original Hebrew and Greek text. Therefore, I’m going to use the NIV.

1.	I like to sing. My voice is quite good. My vocal range isn’t bad either (F2–F5). So people want to listen to me sing.
2.	Now back to the Bible. There’s a book in the Bible called Psalms. It’s meant to be sung.
3.	“Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.” — 1 Chronicles 16:9 (NIV)
4.	“Miriam sang to them: ‘Sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.’” — Exodus 15:21 (NIV)

**TL;DR: Sing.**
