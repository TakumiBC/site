Yin–Yang and the Five Agents are the foundations of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). While these concepts might seem difficult and mysterious—not only to foreigners, but even to native Chinese speakers—they are, at their core, simply two **classification methods**. 

## Tai-chi (太極)

Not Kung-fu. No.

Tai-chi is simply the thing as a whole that you want to classify. After deciding **what** is the Tai-chi, you can decide **how** to classify it, using the methods below.

## Yin–Yang (陰陽)

Simply **binary**.

Yes. I'm not joking.

The core of Yin–Yang theory is to classify anything into two parts. For example, death is Yin, and life is Yang. Night is Yin, and day is Yang.

## Five Agents (a.k.a. Five Elements) (五行)

Simply the Pro Max version of Yin–Yang. They classify things into **two**; we classify things into **five**.

The order of the Five Agents is: **Wood** (木), **Fire** (火), **Earth** (土), **Metal** (金), and **Water** (水). Wood and Fire are **Yang**, Metal and Water are **Yin**, and Earth sits **between** them.

Why this specific order? Because they **generate** each other in this order (the generative cycle).

Let's use an example: 

- **Wood** burns as fuel, which generates **Fire**

- **Fire** produces ashes, which are equivalent to **Earth**

- **Earth** includes **Metal** in it

- **Metal** condenses moisture into **Water**

- **Water** supports the growth of **Wood**

and it repeats.

In addition to the generative cycle, the Five Agents also restrain each other through what is called the **destructive cycle** (相剋). You don’t need to memorize a new order—it simply moves **two steps** forward each time, compared to one step forward in the generative cycle.

In this pattern:

- **Wood** restrains **Earth** (like how roots penetrate soil)

- **Earth** restrains **Water** (like how soil absorbs water)

- **Water** restrains **Fire** (like how water extinguishes fire)

- **Fire** restrains **Metal** (like how fire melts metal)

- **Metal** restrains **Wood** (like how metal cuts wood)

In TCM, the Five Agents are also used to categorize the five major organ systems:

- **Wood** → Liver (肝)  
- **Fire** → Heart (心)  
- **Earth** → Spleen (脾)  
- **Metal** → Lung (肺)  
- **Water** → Kidney (腎)

These are not just anatomical organs in the modern biomedical sense, but functional systems in your body.

## Conclusion

Don't study TCM. Unless you want to.
