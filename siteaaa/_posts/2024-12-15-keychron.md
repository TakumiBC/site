## Hook

About a month ago on my birthday, my friend [@ZigaoWang](https://www.github.com/ZigaoWang) gave me a Keychron K2 Max with Banana switches.

However, the `Fn + F` shortcut which I often use for fullscreening did not work as usual.

After investigating further, I found out that Macs only treat `Fn` keys from Apple's own keyboards as the `Globe` key (which is different from the `Fn` key despite its location), and ignore this signal if it comes from third-party keyboards.

The workaround is to create a keyboard macro which remaps `Fn + F` to `Command + Control + F`, a shortcut that works universally, regardless of the keyboard's brand.

## Steps

1. Connect your Keychron K2 Max to your Mac through a USB-C cable, and turn the keyboard to `Cable` mode.
2. Visit [Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/), choose your keyboard and connect, and then choose `Macro` on the left sidebar.

3. Record a macro. I use `M0` as an example here, with the following content:

```
{+KC_LGUIX+KC_LCTLX+KC_FX-KC_LGUIK-KC_LCTLX-KC_F}
```

Which is equivalent to pressing the left `Control` key, left `Command` key, and `F` key simultaneously, and clicking `Submit` after releasing them.

4. Finally, choose `Keyboard` from the left sidebar, choose `Layer 1`, and map the `F` key to the corresponding macro (`M0` in this example).

This should permanently resolve the issue. Enjoy!
