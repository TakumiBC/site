I am **Thomas Sing-wing Wu**, a high school student from Shanghai, China. I am a computer scientist, swimming athlete, researcher, Traditional Chinese Medicine enthusiast, Sinologist, and a singer? (Maybe).

I founded [LinkScape](https://www.linkscape.app/) in 2022, a student-led open-source organization aimed at empowering young developers to build real-world systems and collaborative infrastructure, and completed a three-month paid virtual internship with [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) in 2023—both when I was thirteen.

In 2024, I competed in the Hong Kong Swimming Olympic Trials.

My academic interests focus primarily on natural language processing and computational linguistics, especially when combined with philosophy and Sinology.

I am also a member of the [Linguistic Society of Hong Kong](https://lshk.org/).

I am native in English and several Chinese dialects, including Mandarin, Shanghainese, Cantonese, and Old National Pronunciation , and am also new to Spanish.
